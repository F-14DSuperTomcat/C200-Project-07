# Project Name

MSCH-C220 Final Project

## Theme

I interpreted the objective of creating a "One-Button Game" as a game that only requires one button to play. Thinking back to when my dad showed me NES Baseball (1985), I figured that swinging a bat was one of the easiest and most entertaining things that can be done with just one button.

## Game Play

Objective
The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible before striking out. To get points, the player must press spacebar at the right time to hit the ball for a home run. The pitcher, while not throwing any pitches with motion, makes this more difficult for the player by throwing pitches at varying velocities. The player strikes out after missing 3 pitches, in which case they will be taken to a game over screen with the option to either go back to the main menu to start again or quit the game. 

## What did you

I struggled with the math required for more in-depth hitting mechanics, which I eventually realized was too out-of-scope for this project, so I wound up just making the ball move in a random direction to give the illusion of skill to the player, especially since hitting it in the first place is hard enough (my high score is 13). I also couldn't figure out how to make the high score save across playthroughs, but I plan to solve that in the future.

## Special Focus

What is your special focus? What did you do for it? How would you rate your own effort? 1-5. (I will agree or disagree with this sentiment, but I want to know what you thought)

My special focus was programming/polish. I spent the majority of my time on the project deep in Visual Scripting, trying to make the game work just right. In spending so much time programming, I also had to spend lots of time on overall polish to make the quality of the programming match the quality of the game. Having spent just shy of 24 hours cumulative working on this project, with probably 18 of those hours being spent on this aspect, I would rate my effort a 5.
